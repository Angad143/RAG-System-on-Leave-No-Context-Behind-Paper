       " Document(page_content='Preprint. Under review.\\nIn this work, we introduce a novel approach that enables Transformer LLMs to effectively\\nprocess infinitely long inputs with bounded memory footprint and computation. A key\\ncomponent in our proposed approach is a new attention technique dubbed Infini-attention\\n(Figure 1). The Infini-attention incorporates a compressive memory into the vanilla attention\\nmechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Vaswani et al., 2017) and builds in both masked local\\nattention and long-term linear attention mechanisms in a single Transformer block.\\nSuch a subtle but critical modification to the Transformer attention layer enables a natural\\nextension of existing LLMs to infinitely long contexts via continual pre-training and fine-\\ntuning.\\nOur Infini-attention reuses all the key, value and query states of the standard attention\\ncomputation for long-term memory consolidation and retrieval. We store old KV states of\\nthe attention in the compressive memory, instead of discarding them like in the standard\\nattention mechanism. We then retrieve the values from the memory by using the attention\\nquery states when processing subsequent sequences. To compute the final contextual\\noutput, the Infini-attention aggregates the long-term memory-retrieved values and the local\\nattention contexts.\\nIn our experiments, we show that our approach outperforms baseline models on long-\\ncontext language modeling benchmarks while having 114x comprehension ratio in terms of\\nmemory size. The model achieves even better perplexity when trained with 100K sequence\\nlength. A 1B LLM naturally scales to 1M sequence length and solves the passkey retrieval\\ntask when injected with Infini-attention. Finally, we show that a 8B model with Infini-\\nattention reaches a new SOTA result on a 500K length book summarization task after\\ncontinual pre-training and task fine-tuning.\\nIn summary, our work makes the following contributions:\\n1.We introduce a practical and yet powerful attention mechanism – Infini-attention\\nwith long-term compressive memory and local causal attention for efficiently mod-\\neling both long and short-range contextual dependencies.\\n2.Infini-attention introduces minimal change to the standard scaled dot-product atten-\\ntion and supports plug-and-play continual pre-training and long-context adaptation\\nby design.\\n3.Our approach enables Transformer LLMs to scale to infinitely long context with a\\nbounded memory and compute resource by processing extremely long inputs in a\\nstreaming fashion.\\n2 Method\\nFigure 2 compares our model, Infini-Transformer, and Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019).\\nSimilar to Transformer-XL, Infini-Transformer operates on a sequence of segments. We\\ncompute the standard causal dot-product attention context within each segment. So the\\ndot-product attention computation is local in a sense that it covers a total Nnumber of\\ntokens of the current segment with index S(Nis the segment length).\\nThe local attention (Dai et al., 2019), however, discards the attention states of the previous\\nsegment when processing the next one. In Infini-Transformers, instead of leaving out the\\nold KV attention states, we propose to reuse them to maintain the entire context history\\nwith a compressive memory. So each attention layer of Infini-Transformers has both global\\ncompressive and local fine-grained states. We call such an efficient attention mechanism\\nInfini-attention, which is illustrated in Figure 1 and described formally in the following\\nsections.\\n2.1 Infini-attention\\nAs shown Figure 1, our Infini-attention computes both local and global context states and\\ncombine them for its output.

Under review.\\nWhile there are different forms of compressive memory proposed in the literature (Hop-\\nfield, 1982; Kanerva, 1988; Schlag et al., 2019; Munkhdalai et al., 2019), for simplicity and\\ncomputational efficiency, in this work we parameterize the memory with an associative\\nmatrix (Schlag et al., 2020). This approach further allows us to cast the memory update\\nand retrieval process as linear attention mechanism (Shen et al., 2018) and to leverage\\nstable training techniques from the related methods. Specially, we adopt the update rule\\nand retrieval mechanism by Katharopoulos et al. (2020) mainly due to its simplicity and\\ncompetitive performance.\\nMemory retrieval. In Infini-attention, we retrieve new content Amem∈I RN×dvaluefrom the\\nmemory Ms−1∈I Rdkey×dvalueby using the query Q∈I RN×dkeyas:\\nAmem=σ(Q)Ms−1\\nσ(Q)zs−1. (3)\\nHere, σand zs−1∈I Rdkeyare a nonlinear activation function and a normalization term,\\nrespectively. As the choice of the non-linearity and the norm method is crucial for training\\nstability, following Katharopoulos et al. (2020) we record a sum over all keys as the normal-\\nization term zs−1and use element-wise ELU + 1 as the activation function (Clevert et al.,\\n2015).\\nMemory update. Once the retrieval is done, we update the memory and the normalization\\nterm with the new KV entries and obtain the next states as\\nMs←Ms−1+σ(K)TVand zs←zs−1+N\\n∑\\nt=1σ(Kt). (4)\\nThe new memory states Msand zsare then passed to the next segment S+1, building in\\na recurrence in each attention layer. The right side term σ(K)TVin Eq. (4)is known as an\\nassociative binding operator (Smolensky, 1990; Hebb, 2005; Schlag et al., 2020).\\nInspired by the success of delta rule (Munkhdalai et al., 2019; Schlag et al., 2020; 2021),\\nwe have also incorporated it into our Infini-attention. The delta rule attempts a slightly\\nimproved memory update by first retrieving existing value entries and subtracting them\\nfrom the new values before applying the associative bindings as new update.\\nMs←Ms−1+σ(K)T(V−σ(K)Ms−1\\nσ(K)zs−1). (5)\\nThis update rule ( Linear +Delta ) leaves the associative matrix unmodified if the KV binding\\nalready exists in the memory while still tracking the same normalization term as the former\\none ( Linear ) for numerical stability.\\nLong-term context injection. We aggregate the local attention state Adotand memory\\nretrieved content Amemvia a learned gating scalar β:\\nA=sigmoid (β)⊙Amem+ (1−sigmoid (β))⊙Adot. (6)\\nThis adds only a single scalar value as training parameter per head while allowing a\\nlearnable trade-off between the long-term and local information flows in the model (Wu\\net al., 2022).\\nSimilar to the standard MHA, for the multi-head Infini-attention we compute Hnumber of\\ncontext states in parallel, and concatenate and project them for the final attention output\\nO∈I RN×dmodel:\\nO= [A1; . . .AH]WO (7)\\nwhere WO∈I RH×dvalue×dmodelis trainable weights.\\n2.2 Memory and Effective Context Window\\nOur Infini-Transformer enables an unbounded context window with a bounded memory\\nfootprint.

Inspired by the plasticity in biological neurons (Munkhdalai & Yu,\\n2017a; Miconi et al., 2018), compressive memory approaches cast parameterized functions\\nas memory to store and retrieve information (Hinton & Plaut, 1987; Schmidhuber, 1992; Ba\\net al., 2016; Munkhdalai et al., 2019). Unlike the Transformer KV memory array (Vaswani\\net al., 2017; Wu et al., 2022), which grows with input sequence length, compressive memory\\nsystems maintain a constant number of memory parameters for computational efficiency.\\nThe parameters are modified with an update rule to store information, which is then\\nretrieved via a memory reading mechanism (Graves et al., 2014; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015;\\nMunkhdalai & Yu, 2017b).\\nCompressed input representations can be viewed as a summary of past sequence seg-\\nments (Rae et al., 2019; Chevalier et al., 2023). Along this direction, more recent works\\nhave been utilizing a Transformer LLM itself to compress input sequence for efficient long-\\ncontext modeling (Bulatov et al., 2022; Chevalier et al., 2023; Ge et al., 2023; Mu et al.,\\n2024). However, the previous segment-level compression methods, including Compressive\\nTransformers (Rae et al., 2019) still discard the memory entries of old segments in order to\\nfree up space for the new ones, limiting their context window to the most recent segments.\\nThis is in contrast to our Infini-attention that computes incremental memory updates to a\\nfixed amount of memory parameters in a recurrent fashion.\\nLong-context continual pre-training. There is a line of work that extends the do-product\\nattention layers and continues to train LLMs for long-context (Xiong et al., 2023; Fu et al.,\\n2024). The attention extensions include incorporating sparsity into the attention layer (Chen\\net al., 2023b; Ratner et al., 2022; Mohtashami & Jaggi, 2024) as well as manipulating the\\nposition encodings (Chen et al., 2023a; Peng et al., 2023) Although the position encoding-\\nbased methods such as position interpolation techniques (Chen et al., 2023a) can be data\\nefficient as they only adjust the positional bias in the attention layer, they are still costly for\\ninference.\\nThe attention mechanism is also prone to the issues of attention sink (Xiao et al., 2023) and\\nlost-in-the-middle (Liu et al., 2024). Consequently, they struggle in a regime where context\\nlength is longer than what was observed during training (Press et al., 2021; Kazemnejad\\net al., 2024). The proposed Infini-attention addresses those issues by enabling a segment-\\nlevel streaming computation over long sequences with a fixed local attention window. Our\\nInfini-Transformers successfully extrapolate to 1M input length regimes when trained on\\n32K and even 5K length sequences.\\nEfficient attention. The efficient attention techniques attempt to improve the efficiency of\\nthe dot-product attention with an approximation or a system-level optimization. Multiple\\ndirections have been explored for different forms of efficient attention approximation,\\nincluding sparsity-based (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020; Sukhbaatar et al., 2021;\\nDing et al., 2023) and linear attention approximation (Shen et al., 2018; Katharopoulos et al.,\\n2020; Schlag et al., 2021). Among those, the linear attention variants are closely related\\nto the associative memory matrix (Schlag et al., 2020; 2021) and the metalearned neural\\nmemory (Munkhdalai et al., 2019), where KV bindings (Smolensky, 1990) are stored in\\nFast-Weights (Hinton & Plaut, 1987; Schmidhuber, 1992; Ba et al., 2016) that are modified\\nin with respect to new contextual information. More recently, system-level optimization\\ntechniques have been proposed by leveraging specific hardware architecture to make the\\nexact attention computation more efficient (Dao et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023).\\n8', metadata={'source': 'Data/Leave No Context Behind Paper.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",

This work introduces a close integration of compressive memory mod-\\nule into the vanilla dot-product attention layer. This subtle but critical modification to the\\nattention layer enables LLMs to process infinitely long contexts with bounded memory and\\ncomputation resources. We show that our approach can naturally scale to a million length\\nregime of input sequences, while outperforming the baselines on long-context language\\nmodeling benchmark and book summarization tasks. We also demonstrate a promising\\nlength generalization capability of our approach. 1B model that was fine-tuned on up to 5K\\nsequence length passkey instances solved the 1M length problem.\\nReferences\\nRohan Anil, Andrew M Dai, Orhan Firat, Melvin Johnson, Dmitry Lepikhin, Alexandre\\nPassos, Siamak Shakeri, Emanuel Taropa, Paige Bailey, Zhifeng Chen, et al.

       "Based on the provided context, Infini-attention appears to be designed specifically to address the limitations of standard attention mechanisms when dealing with long sequences. However, there might still be practical limitations for **extremely** long sequences, depending on the specific implementation and hardware constraints. Here's an analysis:\n",

       "**Points suggesting Infini-attention's ability to handle long sequences:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Addresses attention sink and lost-in-the-middle issues:** The context explicitly states that Infini-attention tackles these problems, which are known to hinder performance in long sequences.\n",
       "* **Segment-level streaming computation:** This approach allows processing long sequences with a fixed local attention window, avoiding the need to attend to the entire sequence at once.\n",
       "* **Long-term compressive memory:** This component helps capture long-range dependencies efficiently, crucial for understanding context in extensive sequences.\n",
       "* **Successful extrapolation to 1M input length:** The provided information indicates successful scaling of Infini-attention to very long sequences (1 million tokens) when trained on significantly shorter ones (32K or even 5K tokens).\n",
       "\n",
       "**Potential limitations for extremely long sequences:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Hardware constraints:**  Despite efficient design, processing extremely long sequences might still demand significant computational resources and memory, potentially leading to limitations on certain hardware configurations.\n",
       "* **Unforeseen edge cases:**  While the provided information suggests excellent performance, there might be specific edge cases or extremely long sequence lengths where Infini-attention's efficiency or accuracy could degrade. \n",
       "* **Specific implementation details:** The efficiency and scalability of Infini-attention likely depend on the specific implementation choices and optimizations made. \n",
